ABOUT PROJECT:

I started this project out intending it to be a comprehensive budgeting tool that takes a user's monthly income(s) and expenses, tracks it and uses this information in conjunction with a user's stated retirement date and the amount they would like to have in savings at that time to calculate what their monthly budgeting should look like. I overwhelmed myself by not planning it thoroughly at the beginning stage but I plan to expand this project in the future with additional features. These features will include user input for expenses/income(s), I will account for compounding interest, rising expenses/cost of living due to inflation, a constant growth in salary, and other time value of money concepts. The project will also feature a downloadable .csv budget document that will be updated and allow the user to follow it to be able to stay on track toward their retirement goals.

CURRENTLY, the project takes a cashflow csv document (provided), organizes it so that it can display visually and does some data manipulation in the form of adding an additional column labeling expenses as "necessary" or "unnecessary".

This project is built to meet the following requirements of Python of Code Louisville January 2021 session. 

1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
